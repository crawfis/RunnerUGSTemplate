# Add Event

Add new events to the RunnerUGS event-driven architecture. Every action in this codebase MUST go through the event system.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Feature name and optionally the domain (GameFlow, TempleRun, UserInitiated, UGS)

## Procedure

### Step 1: Determine the correct domain

Ask the user if not obvious from context:

| Domain | Enum File | When to use |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **GameFlow** | `Assets/GameFlow/Scripts/Events/GameFlowEvents.cs` | App lifecycle: loading, menus, pause, quit, scenes, config |
| **TempleRun** | `Assets/TempleRun/Scripts/Events/TempleRunEvents.cs` | Gameplay: player actions, countdown, turns, track, collisions, coins, power-ups |
| **UserInitiated** | `Assets/TempleRun/Scripts/Events/UserInitiatedEvents.cs` | Raw input: new player-triggered actions |
| **GameServiceEvents** | `Runtime/GameServiceEvents.cs` in the `com.crawfissoftware.contracts` package | The game/service contract. Add here only when a crossing is genuinely game-agnostic |
| **UGS** | `Runtime/Events/UGS_EventsEnum.cs` in the `com.crawfissoftware.ugs` package (read-only here) | Unity Gaming Services: auth, leaderboards, achievements, remote config, economy |

> This table lists the domains that exist today. The authoritative list is the set of
> `[EventEnum]`-marked enums (`CrawfisSoftware > Events > List Domains` sweeps them) —
> update this table when a domain is added. If the feature genuinely needs a domain that doesn't exist yet (rare),
> run `/add-event-domain` first — its decision gate tells you whether you really do.

### Step 2: Read the target enum file

Read the enum file to find:
- The highest existing enum value in the relevant category
- Existing category comment blocks (e.g., `// ---------- Category ----------`)
- The naming pattern used

### Step 3: Generate the event group

Follow the naming convention. Most features need a lifecycle group:

```
*Requested    - User or system initiated a request
*Starting/*ing - Action is beginning (async in progress)
*Started/*ed  - Action completed successfully
*Failed       - Action failed
*Cancelled    - Action was cancelled (optional)
```

Choose the appropriate subset. Not all features need all states. For example:
- Simple toggle: `FeatureRequested`, `FeatureActivated`, `FeatureDeactivated`
- Async operation: `FeatureRequested`, `FeatureStarting`, `FeatureStarted`, `FeatureFailed`
- UI panel: `FeatureShowRequested`, `FeatureShowing`, `FeatureShown`, `FeatureHideRequested`, `FeatureHiding`, `FeatureHidden`

### Step 4: Assign enum values

- Find the next available value range (gaps of 10 between categories)
- Values within a group are sequential
- Add a category comment header: `// ---------- Feature Name ----------`
- Exceptions — `UserInitiatedEvents` (implicit values, `User` prefix, no categories;
  append at the end) and `UGS_EventsEnum` (implicit values; append inside the right
  category block)

### Step 5: Edit the enum file

Add the new events to the enum. Place them in a logical location (near related features or at the end).

### Step 6: Ask about auto-chaining and bridges

After adding events, ask:
- "Should any of these auto-chain? (e.g., *Requested -> *Starting)" — if yes, suggest running `/add-auto-chain`
- "Do any of these need to bridge to another domain?" — if yes, suggest running `/add-bridge-mapping`

### Step 7: Summarize

Output a summary:
```
Added to [Domain]Events:
  [FeatureName]Requested = [value]
  [FeatureName]Starting  = [value]
  [FeatureName]Started   = [value]
  [FeatureName]Failed    = [value]

Next steps:
  /add-auto-chain  — if these should auto-chain
  /add-bridge-mapping — if these cross domains
```

## Example

For "adding obstacle detection":
- Domain: TempleRun (gameplay mechanic)
- Events: `ObstacleDetected`, `ObstacleAvoidRequested`, `ObstacleAvoiding`, `ObstacleAvoided`, `ObstacleAvoidFailed`
- Values: next available in TempleRun Hazards/Collisions category (120+)
